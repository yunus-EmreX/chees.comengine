Stockfish-Like Chess Engine

This is a chess engine similar to Stockfish, one of the strongest and most popular chess engines in the world. It is designed to analyze chess positions, calculate the best moves, and provide a challenging opponent for players of all skill levels.

Features:

    Powerful chess engine based on the Stockfish algorithm
    Advanced search techniques for efficient move calculation
    Support for various chess variants (e.g., standard chess, Fischer Random Chess)
    Configurable parameters for fine-tuning engine behavior
    Multi-threaded architecture for improved performance

Usage:

    Install the required dependencies (e.g., chess libraries, compilers)
    Compile the source code using your preferred compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
    Run the executable file to start the chess engine
    Enter moves in standard algebraic notation to play against the engine or analyze positions
